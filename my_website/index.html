    <h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello, my name is Marisa Rae</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I really do hate programing so lets see how i do in this class</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">I'm a seventeen year old senior at S.T.E.M Early College High School.
After high school i plan to go to UTSA where i will be studing civil engineering to get my Bacholors.
After my bacholors at UTSA i will transfer to A&M College Staion to work towards my Masters in Structual civil engineering.
I have a goofy dog that i love and i also believe i share custody with shakira honey.
I hope one day I will travel to the most beautiful beaches in the world.</p>
